							<h1>About</h1>
							Grid is a graphical user interface for Kodi, an award-winning free and open source software entertainment hub available on Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and iOS. It aims to provide an elegant and intuitive way of enjoying Kodi's featureset and to extend on it in a sensible way. To find out more about Kodi click here.

							Grid's design and development process focuses on feature quality rather than quantity with a lot of time and care spent on the little details that matter.
							Grid makes choices, It is not a swiss army knife type of skin where every bit of whitespace must be used. No slapped together solutions without any thought to integration or a toggle for everything on screen, Grid has focus.
