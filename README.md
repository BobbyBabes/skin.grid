### About
Grid is a graphical user interface for Kodi. The goal for Grid is to provide an elegant and intuitive way of enjoying all the wonderful features that Kodi provides. The design and development focuses on feature quality rather than quantity with a lot of attention spent on the little details that matter.

### Compatibility
Currently Grid is compatible with Kodi 17 Krypton only. Kodi 18 Leia compatibility is being worked on.

### Language support
Grid supports Cyrillic (extended), Greek (extended), Hebrew, Latin (extended) and Vietnamese characters. Any other language is supported through the Unicode (Arial) fontset, but this comes with compromises in looks and usability.
